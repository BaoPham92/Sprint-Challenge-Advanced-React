- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
```
I would use class components when more manual logics needs implementation. This would give me slightly more control and verastility.
```
- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

```
1. ComponentWillMount()
------------------------------

This is a life cycle method allowing for specific logic to be implemented right when a component has been mounted.

2. ComponentDidUpdate()
------------------------------

This is a life cycle method allowing a user to implement logic for whenever a specific action like clicking inside of `this` particular component, do specific logic.

3. ComponentDidUnmount()
------------------------------

This is a life cycle method allowing for specific logic to be implemented right before a component is being unmounted.
```

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
```
The purpose of a custom hook, is reusability when it comes to cutting down repetitive implementation, and or code clean up.
```
- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

```
It is important to test our apps because of the `Quality Code` standard for some dev environments, make it easier to not only having confident code, but also a confident project for collaboration, and also simple debugging.
